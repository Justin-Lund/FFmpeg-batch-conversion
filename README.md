## ffmpeg batch conversion

This is a quick and dirty script to convert batches of files using [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)

It will grab all files of a specified filetype in a folder, and convert them to your target filetype

This example is to convert **FLAC audio to AIFF**
Replace the extension types & the ffmpeg command paramaters as needed

[ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) must be in your PATH directory ([Instructions](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/))
